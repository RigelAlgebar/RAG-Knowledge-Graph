What's next for OpenAI? Here are our predictions for AI in 2024.\\n\\nThis last year was a banger for AI as the technology went from niche to mainstream about as fast as anything ever has. 2024, however, will be the year when the hype runs full-steam into reality as people reckon with the capabilities and limitations of AI at large. Here are a few ways we think that\\u2019s going to play out.\\n\\nOpenAI becomes a product company\\n\\nAfter the leadership shake-up in November, OpenAI is going to be a changed company \\u2014 perhaps not outwardly, but the trickle-down effect of Sam Altman being more fully in charge will be felt at every level. And one of the ways we expect that to manifest is in \\u201cship it\\u201d mindset.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ll see that with the GPT store, originally planned for launch in December but understandably delayed due to the C-suite fracas. The \\u201capp store for AI\\u201d will be pushed hard as the platform to get your AI toys and tools from, and never mind Hugging Face or any open source models. They have an excellent model to work from, Apple\\u2019s, and will follow it all the way to the bank.\\n\\nExpect more moves like that from 2024\\u2019s OpenAI as the caution and academic reserve that the previous board exerted gives way to an unseemly lust for markets and customers.\\n\\nOther major companies with AI efforts will also follow this trend (for instance, expect Gemini/Bard to horn in on a ton of Google products), but I suspect it will be more pronounced in this case.\\n\\nAgents, generated video and generated music graduate from quaint to experimental\\n\\nSome niche applications of AI models will grow beyond \\u201ceh\\u201d status in 2024, including agent-based models and generative multimedia.\\n\\nIf AI is going to help you do more than summarize or make lists of things, it\\u2019ll need access to things like your spreadsheets, ticket buying interfaces, transportation apps and so on. 2023 saw a few tentative attempts at this \\u201cagent\\u201d approach, but none really caught on. We don\\u2019t really expect any to really take off in 2024, either, but agent-based models will show their stuff a little more convincingly than they did last year, and a few clutch use cases will show up for famously tedious processes like submitting insurance claims.\\n\\nVideo and audio will also find niches where their shortcomings aren\\u2019t quite so visible. In the hands of skilled creators, a lack of photorealism isn\\u2019t a problem, and we\\u2019ll see AI video used in fun and interesting ways. Likewise, generative music models will likely make it into a few major productions like games, again where professional musicians can leverage the tools to create an unending soundtrack.\\n\\nThe limits of monolithic LLMs become clearer\\n\\nSo far there has been great optimism about the capabilities of large language models, which have indeed proved more capable than anyone expected, and have grown correspondingly more so as more compute is added. But 2024 will be the year something gives. Where exactly it is impossible to predict, as research is active at the frontiers of this field.\\n\\nThe seemingly magical \\u201cemergent\\u201d capabilities of LLMs will be better studied and understood in 2024, and things like their inability to multiply large numbers will make more sense.\\n\\nIn parallel, we will begin to see diminishing returns on parameter counts, to the point where training a 500-billion-parameter model may technically produce better results, but the compute required to do so could provably be deployed more effectively. A single monolithic model is unwieldy and expensive, while a mixture of experts \\u2014 a collection of smaller, more specific models and likely multimodal ones \\u2014 may prove almost as effective while being much easier to update piecemeal.\\n\\nMarketing meets reality\\n\\nThe simple fact is that the hype built up in 2023 is going to be very hard for companies to follow through on. Marketing claims made for machine learning systems that companies adopted in order to not fall behind will receive their quarterly and yearly reviews\\u2026 and it\\u2019s very likely they will be found wanting.\\n\\nExpect a considerable customer withdrawal from AI tools as the benefits fail to justify the costs and risks. On the far end of this spectrum, we are likely to see lawsuits and regulatory action with AI service providers that failed to back up their claims.\\n\\nWhile capabilities will continue to grow and advance, 2023\\u2019s products will not all survive by a long shot, and there will be a round of consolidation as the wobblier riders of the wave fall and are consumed.\\n\\nApple jumps in\\n\\nApple has an established pattern of waiting, watching and learning from other companies\\u2019 failures, then blowing in with a refined and polished take that puts others to shame. The timing is right for Apple to do this in AI, not just because if it waits too long its competition may eat up the market, but because the tech is ripe for their kind of improvement.\\n\\nI would expect an AI that focuses on practical applications of users\\u2019 own data, using Apple\\u2019s increasingly central position in their lives to integrate the many signals and ecosystems the company is privy to. There will likely also be a clever and elegant way to handle problematic or dangerous prompts, and although it will almost certainly have multimodal understanding (primarily to handle user images), I imagine they\\u2019ll totally skip media generation. Expect some narrowly tailored but impressive agent capabilities as well: \\u201cSiri, get a table for 4 at a sushi place downtown around 7 and book a car to take us\\u201d sort of thing.\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s hard to say is whether they will bill it as an improved Siri or as a whole new service, Apple AI, with a name you can choose yourself. They may feel the old brand is freighted with years of being comparatively incapable, but millions already say \\u201chey Siri\\u201d every 10 seconds so it\\u2019s more likely they\\u2019ll opt to keep that momentum.\\n\\nLegal cases build and break\\n\\nWe saw a fair number of lawsuits filed in 2023, but few saw any real movement, let alone success. Most suits over copyright and other missteps in the AI industry are still pending. 2024 will see a lot of them fall by the wayside, as companies stonewall critical information like training data and methods, making allegations like the use of thousands of copyrighted books difficult to prove in court.\\n\\nThis was only the beginning, however, and many of these lawsuits were filed essentially on principle. Though they may not succeed, they may crack the process open far enough during testimony and discovery that companies would rather settle than have certain information come to light. 2024 will bring new lawsuits as well, ones pertaining to misuse and abuse of AI, such as wrongful termination, bias in hiring and lending, and other areas where AI is being put to work without a lot of thought.\\n\\nBut while a few egregious examples of misuse will be punished, a lack of relevant laws specific to it means that it will necessarily only haphazardly be brought to court. On that note\\u2026\\n\\nEarly adopters take new rules by the horns\\n\\nBig moves like the EU\\u2019s AI Act could change how the industry works, but they tend to be slow to take effect. That\\u2019s by design, so companies don\\u2019t have to adjust to new rules overnight, but it also means that we won\\u2019t see the effect of these big laws for a good while except among those willing to make changes preemptively and voluntarily. There will be a lot of \\u201cwe are beginning the process of\\u2026\\u201d talk. (Also expect a few quiet lawsuits challenging various parts of laws.)\\n\\nTo that end we can expect a newly flourishing AI compliance industry as the billions going into the technology prompt matching investments (at a smaller scale, but still considerable) in making sure the tools and processes meet international and local standards.\\n\\nUnfortunately for anyone hoping for substantive federal regulation in the U.S., 2024 is not the year to expect movement on that front. Though it will be a year for AI and everyone will be asking for new laws, the U.S. government and electorate will be too busy with the trash fire that will be the 2024 election.\\n\\nThe 2024 election is a trash fire and AI makes it worse\\n\\nHow the 2024 presidential election will play out is, really, anyone\\u2019s guess right now. Too many things are up in the air to make any real predictions except that, as before, the influence mongers will use every tool in the box to move the needle, including AI in whatever form is convenient.\\n\\nFor instance, expect bot accounts and fake blogs to spout generated nonsense 24/7. A few people working full time with a text and image generator can cover a lot of ground, generating hundreds of social media and blog posts with totally fabricated images and news. \\u201cFlooding the zone\\u201d has always been an effective tactic and now AI acts as a labor multiplier, allowing more voluminous yet also targeted campaigns. Expect both false positives and false negatives in a concerted effort to confuse the narrative and make people distrust everything they see and read. That\\u2019s a win state for those politicians who thrive in chaos.\\n\\nOrganizations will tout \\u201cAI-powered\\u201d analyses to back up purges of voter rolls, challenges to vote counts and other efforts to suppress or interfere with existing processes.\\n\\nGenerated video and audio will join the fray, and though neither are perfect, they\\u2019re good enough to be believable given a bit of fuzzing: The clip doesn\\u2019t have to be perfect, because it will be presented as a grainy zoomed-in cellphone capture in a dark room, or a hot mic at a private event, or what have you. Then it becomes a matter of \\u201cwho are you going to believe, me or him?\\u201d And that\\u2019s all some people need.\\n\\nLikely there will be some half-hearted efforts to block generated content from being used in this way, but these posts can\\u2019t be taken down fast enough by the likes of Meta and Google, and the idea that X can (or will) effectively monitor and take down such content is implausible. It\\u2019s gonna be a bad time!\",\n          \"Could a craving for salty chips actually be a sign of addiction?\\n\\nA new study from the University of Michigan suggests that could be the case.\\n\\nResearchers reviewed 281 studies from 36 different countries, finding that 14% of adults and 12% of children showed signs of addiction to ultra - processed foods , according to the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS).\\n\\nULTRA-PROCESSED FOOD CONSUMPTION LINKED TO HIGHER RISK OF DEATH FROM OVARIAN, BREAST CANCERS: NEW STUDY\\n\\nThat\\u2019s close to the addiction levels seen for alcohol and tobacco, noted the study article, which was published in the journal BMJ.\\n\\nUltra-processed foods are those that are high in carbohydrates and fats, such as candy, ice cream and potato chips.\\n\\nThe study suggests that some people\\u2019s consumption of these foods may meet the criteria for substance use disorder , resulting in the \\\"biopsychological mechanisms of addiction and clinically significant problems.\\\"\\n\\nPart of the reason that ultra-processed foods have addictive properties is that they deliver fats and carbs to the gut much faster than minimally processed foods, the researchers wrote.\\n\\nThese foods also contain flavor and texture additives that could make them more addictive.\\n\\nDEPRESSION RISK SPIKES FOR THOSE WHO EAT THESE UNHEALTHY FOODS, STUDY FINDS: \\u2018NOT A COINCIDENCE\\u2019\\n\\n\\\"There is converging and consistent support for the validity and clinical relevance of ultra-processed food addiction,\\\" said lead researcher Ashley Gearhardt, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, in a press release announcing the study.\\n\\n\\\"By acknowledging that certain types of processed foods have the properties of addictive substances, we may be able to help improve global health.\\\"\\n\\nTanya Freirich, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Charlotte, North Carolina , who was not involved in the study, called out several warning signs of addictive behaviors surrounding food.\\n\\nThese include thinking about food all the time or obsessively, craving foods when not hungry, craving foods as a coping mechanism, eating even after feeling full, having reduced control over intake, experiencing symptoms of withdrawal, and continuing to eat certain foods despite negative consequences.\\n\\nSUGAR SUBSTITUTES NOT ADVISED FOR WEIGHT LOSS OR DISEASE PREVENTION, SAYS WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION\\n\\n\\\"While you can enjoy food thoroughly, being addicted to food starts to veer into an unhealthy territory with detrimental effects for the rest of your life,\\\" Freirich told Fox News Digital.\\n\\n\\\"For example, overeating past the point of comfort or to the point of causing digestive distress, or struggling to concentrate on other topics besides food and meals, can be signs of a food addiction.\\\"\\n\\nGearhardt noted that 103 countries have passed \\\"sugar-sweetened beverage taxes,\\\" and several others have additional taxes for ultra-processed foods.\\n\\nMore than 20 countries have also added nutrition labels to these foods, she wrote.\\n\\n\\\"It\\u2019s essential to understand the addiction to these ultra-processed foods globally, particularly in low- and middle-income countries,\\\" Gearhardt said in the release.\\n\\n\\\"Chronic dieting, food shame, food accessibility and even early childhood feeding experiences can all be tied back to food choices and disordered eating habits.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It will take courageous action to change these and other economic and structural factors that drive people toward ultra-processed foods.\\\"\\n\\nFreirich noted that many countries have banned the production of foods with certain additives that are shown to be detrimental.\\n\\n6 WAYS TO TAKE YOUR SALAD FROM BORING TO BOUNTIFUL: HEALTHY FATS AND SMART PREP ARE JUST SOME OF THE SECRETS\\n\\n\\\"The USDA and FDA could make similar steps to ensure that foods are safe for consumption,\\\" she recommended.\\n\\nErin Palinski-Wade, a New Jersey-based dietitian with a focus on diabetes and nutrition, is skeptical that foods can be as addictive as drugs. (She was not involved in the study.)\\n\\n\\\"Although foods rich in added sugar may stimulate the feel-good chemicals in the brain and become habit-forming, sugar itself is not addictive in the way cocaine or another drug may be,\\\" she told Fox News Digital.\\n\\n\\\"Consuming sugar and then reducing or eliminating it from the diet will not result in withdrawal symptoms or side effects as would happen from a true addiction,\\\" she continued.\\n\\n\\\"Food cravings are complex and tied into not just the nutrition profile of a food, but also the emotions and learned behaviors around eating.\\\"\\n\\nAPPLE A DAY \\u2014 AND 4 OTHER GREAT FALL FOOD CHOICES THAT ARE HEALTHY, DELICIOUS AND FUN\\n\\nEmotions, stress, overall metabolic health, sleep habits and learned feeding behaviors all shape people\\u2019s food choices, behaviors and responses, Palinski-Wade said.\\n\\n\\\"A food craving or binge-eating is almost always tied to an emotional response,\\\" she said. \\\"Chronic dieting, food shame, food accessibility and even early childhood feeding experiences can all be tied back to food choices and disordered eating habits.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough she believes that no single food is addictive, Palinski-Wade acknowledged that foods that are high in added sugar or added fats tend to be associated with the strongest cravings and desire.\\n\\n\\\"These foods often trigger the release of feel-good chemicals such as dopamine in the brain, leading to cravings and potentially addictive-like eating behaviors,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"As you consume more and more of these foods, you build up a dopamine tolerance, meaning that you will have to eat even more of this food to experience the same pleasure response,\\\" Palinksi-Wade said \\u2014 which can contribute to the development of cravings and loss of control over eating behavior.\\n\\nMore research is still needed to fully understand the relationship between food and addiction, the experts all agreed.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\\n\\nThe University of Michigan study was a review and compilation of many other studies' data, Freirich pointed out.\\n\\n\\\"Ideally, to see if the type of food made a difference, you could run a controlled study with people consuming one meal plan with ultra-processed foods and another with minimally processed foods and then measure their reactions \\u2014 thoughts about food, rated enjoyment of food, cravings and dopamine levels,\\\" she said.\\n\\nThose who are struggling with disordered eating , binge-eating or uncontrolled food cravings should work directly with a therapist or registered dietitian experienced in eating disorders, Palinski-Wade recommended.\\n\\n\\\"They can help you to better understand your behaviors and emotions around food and improve your relationship with food so that cravings and addictive behaviors can decrease,\\\" she said.\\n\\nAdditionally, Freirich recommended filling the majority of meals with minimally processed foods , as consuming more of these may result in eating fewer ultra-processed foods.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\\\"Lastly, speak to a dietitian about how to get started on changing your diet for your personal health goals,\\\" she said.\\n\\nFox News Digital reached out to the University of Michigan researcher for additional comments.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"uuid\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 609,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"211841df58054626a2e6a3c02d50f907\",\n          \"5b7033f0e5044f0698ab6302bc7e653e\",\n          \"f1757bbe6be345d69c79fb4b3058e606\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Official Cyber Monday mode, which is currently on through Monday, Nov. 27, includes both a ton of deals carried over from Black Friday plus some new ones.\\n\\nWe\\'re curating a running list of Amazon\\'s best Cyber Weekend deals, spotlighting some of our favorites and noting when good deals inevitably sell out. Read on for the full rundown, and check back often: We\\'re going to be updating this story incessantly as the sale continues, as well as our even bigger (if you can imagine) list of Cyber Monday deals across more retailers.\\n\\nNote: All newly added deals are marked with a ✨, while deals with a 🔥 have dropped to an all-time low price. Amazon\\'s invite-only deals for Prime members are marked with a 📨. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.\\n\\nEcho, Fire TV, and Kindle deals\\n\\nWhy we like it\\n\\nAn Echo Show is a subtle yet game-changing addition to any room — and for less than $40 with this rollover Black Friday to Cyber Monday deal, there\\'s little reason to not make your life easier. The smart screen responds to Alexa commands that are particularly handy when your hands are full, like asking for measurement conversions mid-cooking, checking the weather mid-rushing out the door, or turning off your smart lights with a sleeping kid in hand. Plus, it\\'s got a 5.5-inch screen and better sound than its predecessor, making it perfect for watching videos or video calling friends and family.\\n\\nMore Amazon device and service deals\\n\\nAmazon services\\n\\nAudible Premium Plus — $5.95/month $14.95/month for four months (save $9/month; new customers only; get an additional $20 Audible credit)\\n\\nEcho Buds\\n\\nEcho smart displays\\n\\nEcho smart speakers\\n\\nFire tablets\\n\\nFire TVs\\n\\nNote: All Fire TVs come with a free 6-month subscription to MGM+ (a $35.94 value).\\n\\nFire TV streaming devices\\n\\neero\\n\\nKindles\\n\\nMiscellaneous Amazon devices\\n\\nApple deals\\n\\nWhy we like it\\n\\nNow that the 64GB 9th generation iPad has been going in and out of stock (you might be able to find it on sale for $229.99), our new favorite iPad deal at Amazon is the 10th generation 64GB model for $349. Compared to the 9th gen, the 10th gen classic iPad has a slightly bigger screen that\\'s now also a Liquid Retina display (10.9 inches versus 10.2 inches), a faster A14 Bionic chip for smoother multitasking, and USB-C charging.\\n\\nMore Apple deals\\n\\nAirPods\\n\\nMacBook\\n\\nMac\\n\\niPad\\n\\nApple Watch\\n\\nTV deals\\n\\nWhy we like it\\n\\nThis 65-inch Fire TV from Amazon hit its lowest ever price this month, and we\\'re not mad about it. With a 66 percent five-star review rating, it\\'s got much to love: Including stunning 4K QLED resolution, adaptive brightness that adjusts to the lighting of your room, the ability to project famous art or personal pics on it when not streaming anything, and, of course, that quintessential Alexa voice control.\\n\\nMore TV deals\\n\\n43 to 55 inches\\n\\n65 inches\\n\\n75 to 85 inches\\n\\nLaptop deals\\n\\nWhy we like it\\n\\nMacBooks aside (which are all listed above in the Apple section), another stellar Cyber Monday laptop deal at Amazon is the lightweight Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 3 for $599.99. This 25% discount drops the 2023 version to the regular asking price of our favorite budget laptop, the older Surface Go 2. Compared to the Go 2, the Go 3\\'s Intel Core i5 processor is 12th gen versus the Go 2\\'s 11th gen, harnessing better speeds and solid power for most everyday work or school tasks. On the outside, the Go 3 is definitely giving MacBook Air — the main difference being that the Go 3\\'s screen is a touchscreen.\\n\\nMore laptop deals\\n\\nTraditional laptops\\n\\n2-in-1 laptops\\n\\nChromebooks\\n\\nGaming laptops\\n\\nHeadphone and earbud deals\\n\\nWhy we like it\\n\\nNarrowing down a headphones upgrade from so many on-sale options is less overwhelming when you\\'ve confirmed that you want to stick with a super premium, super reputable brand like Bose — but also that you want to stick to a budget. There\\'s only one pair of Bose over-ear headphones you can grab for just under $200, and that\\'s the QuietComfort 45s at a record-low price of $199. This classic pair secures top-of-the-line ANC, 20 hours of battery life, and all-day comfort for less than half of the AirPods Max\\'s sale price.\\n\\nMore headphone and earbud deals\\n\\nHeadphones\\n\\nEarbuds\\n\\nTablet deals\\n\\nGaming deals\\n\\nGaming headsets\\n\\nMashable Deals Want more hand-picked deals in your inbox?

              "'SBF’s trial has started, this is how he and FTX got here\\n\\nThe highly anticipated criminal trial for Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, started Tuesday to determine whether he’s guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. And as one former federal prosecutor put it: “The odds seem to be stacked against him at this point.”\\n\\nThe 31-year-old co-founded FTX in 2019; within a few years the once third-largest crypto exchange’s valuation hit $32 billion at its peak. It’s now trying to claw back any funds to distribute to creditors.\\n\\nBut how did the once third-largest crypto exchange get here?\\n\\nBefore FTX, Bankman-Fried co-founded crypto-trading firm Alameda Research in 2017. He co-founded FTX in 2019 as a complement to Alameda, to help bring in revenue and liquidity for the trading arm.\\n\\nWithin two years, more than 80 investors provided about $2 billion in capital to FTX, helping Bankman-Fried propel his vision into a reality. In January 2022, the company raised $400 million in a Series C round, boosting its valuation to $32 billion. That was its last round of public funding.\\n\\nThe company gained somewhat mainstream recognition with branding deals and partnerships. For example, in 2021 it bought the naming rights for the Miami Heat’s home arena. FTX also got its name branded on Major League Baseball umpires’ polos, and it partnered with celebrities like Tom Brady and his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen, as well as Steph Curry, Shaquille O’Neal and Naomi Osaka, among others. He also had close ties to U.S. regulators and government officials, many of whom he donated to.\\n\\nBankman-Fried was even compared to Warren Buffet and many called him the white horse of crypto (TechCrunch never did, for what it’s worth).\\n\\nBut in early November 2022, that all changed.\\n\\nFTX’s collapse\\n\\nConcerns surrounding FTX’s liquidity grew after CoinDesk published a copy of Alameda’s balance sheet, showing the firm held $14.6 billion in assets and $8 billion in liabilities as of June 30, 2022.\\n\\nBut there was a problem: The report showed Alameda’s largest asset was $3.66 billion of “unlocked FTT” and $2.16 billion of “FTT collateral.” FTT was the token behind FTX.\\n\\nThe balance sheet showed that the $5.82 billion in FTT tokens that Alameda owned was 193% higher than the total FTT market cap, which was about $3 billion at the time. That means it purported to have more FTT tokens on its balance sheet than what existed in the world.\\n\\nAround the same time it was exposed, the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, started pulling out its remaining $2.1 billion equivalent of cash in BUSD and FTT. (It had an equity position in FTX from 2019 to 2021.) This essentially triggered a bank run on FTX.\\n\\nFTX and Alameda filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. mid-November 2022. Bankman-Fried resigned, and John J. Ray III, the Enron turnaround veteran, was appointed its new CEO.\\n\\nBankman-Fried, however, maintained his innocence. At The New York Times’ DealBook Summit, he appeared virtually from the Bahamas, saying “I didn’t ever try to commit fraud on anyone; I was shocked by what happened this month.” In a published DM exchange with a Vox reporter, he said he regretted filing for bankruptcy and thought that “regulators make everything worse.”\\n\\nSBF arrested\\n\\nBankman-Fried was arrested in December 2022 in the Bahamas, where FTX was based. He was then extradited to the U.S. to face a number of criminal charges. He was released on a $250 million bail bond, and he remained under house arrest at his parents’ home in Palo Alto. This was revoked in August after he was accused of intimidating Alameda’s former CEO, Caroline Ellison, by leaking her private diary.\\n\\nRay represented the company during a House Financial Services Committee hearing regarding FTX. When asked whether the firm had significant risk management systems, Ray said at the time that “there were virtually no internal controls and no separateness whatsoever” and added that he did not “trust a single piece of paper” in the exchange’s organization. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams called Bankman-Fried’s alleged crimes “one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,” in a press conference.\\n\\nThe aftermath\\n\\nFTX co-founder and former CTO Gary Wang, and Alameda Research’s former CEO, Caroline Ellison, both pleaded guilty in December 2022 to federal criminal charges in relation to the FTX collapse. They’re also facing civil penalties from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alongside the criminal charges. Wang and Ellison plan to cooperate with prosecutors and will be major witnesses in the trial, given their close ties to Bankman-Fried, FTX and Alameda.\\n\\nIn January, Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to all counts, which include wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to misuse customer funds. He could face up to 115 years in jail if convicted on all charges.\\n\\nThe crypto industry as a whole suffered from FTX’s collapse, which was the first of many. BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 in November 2022, as did Genesis Global Trading in January.\\n\\nWhere we are today\\n\\nBankman-Fried will be represented by Cohen & Gresser, and Mark Cohen, a high-profile defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, will be the lead attorney. If that name sounds familiar, it might be because he also represented Ghislaine Maxwell in her sex trafficking trial related to Jeffrey Epstein. He requested an early release for Bankman-Fried but was denied.\\n\\nWith the trial beginning, we’re witnessing how FTX’s story ends. But what’s on our mind is what happens to the investors and creditors affected by the collapse? And what happens to the billions in crypto assets tied up in legal proceedings?'"

Today, the EFL is comprised of the second-tier Championship, third-tier League One, and fourth-tier League Two. But Premier League clubs are still invited to participate in the League Cup (EFL Cup) every season.\\n\\nBeginning in the 1990s, corporations began paying to attach their name to this tournament and the sponsor names caught on for brief periods when it was known as the Coca-Cola Cup, the Worthington's Cup, and the Carling Cup.\\n\\nThe latest sponsor is Thai energy drink company Carabao, which bought the title rights of the knockout tournament beginning with the 2017/18 edition, leading to the use of the Carabao Cup moniker that is popularly used today.\""

The episode resurfaced after a source claimed to Yahoo Entertainment that Swift and Travis Kelce “have talked about kids” within the next year.\\n\\nIn the episode of his podcast, the Philadelphia Eagles star asked his mother, Donna, which of her two sons she was “rooting for,” as the Eagles and Chiefs were preparing to play against each other in the Super Bowl at the time.\\n\\n“You’ve said in the past to both of us that you root for me because I’ve given you grandkids,” Jason, who shares three children – Wyatt, four, Elliotte, two, and Bennett, seven months – with wife Kylie Kelce, said. “I’ve always known that you root for Travis. So who do you actually root for?”\\n\\nAfter Jason asked his mother again who she was rooting for, “if in a battle to the death,” Donna responded by asking who he’d pick to save if she and her husband, Ed Kelce, were stranded in the middle of the ocean. While Donna said she couldn’t pick which of her sons to root against, Jason then joked: “Remember if you choose me, Wyatt and Elliotte grow up without a father.”\\n\\nTravis then chimed in to joke about wanting to start his own family. “I gotta start breeding,” he said. “I’ve gotta start breeding, to all the breeders out there.”\\n\\nJason then responded to his brother’s remark with: “Please don’t,” before Donna advised: “Wait until you find the right person. Find the right person.”\\n\\nHowever, Travis still doubled down on his plan, as he quipped: “I’m gonna find a breeder, and I’m gonna get kids so that mom can love me again.”\\n\\nOn X, formerly known as Twitter, fans have called Travis out for his seemingly sexist remarks and claimed that he shouldn’t have been referring to women as “breeders”.\\n\\n“Forever grateful that Joe Alwyn kept to himself and is private,” one wrote, referring to Swift’s ex-boyfriend of six years.“It’s what makes Travis Kelce’s statements from earlier this year about ‘finding a breeder’ cringe. You are free to say what you want but are not free from the consequences of doing so. Women are not objects.”\\n\\n“‘Start breeding,’ oh this is just f***ing disgusting and it’s setting us back so much,” another added. “Women aren’t baby-making machines, women are more than the man they’re dating, we are more than marriage.”\\n\\n“Ain’t a Swiftie but don’t have to be one to be weirded out about Travis Kelce calling women ‘breeders,’” someone else wrote. “That ain’t it dude.”\\n\\nMany other people went on to criticise claims about Swift and Travis having children soon, since the singer is about to return to her Eras Tour until November 2024.\\n\\n“Well I know for DAMN SURE that s*** about ‘having kids within the next year’ is NOT coming from Taylor’s side,” one claimed. “She’s got the Eras Tour booked all through next year, and she’d rather die than cancel a show. But we do know who’s been public about looking for a ‘BREEDER.’”\\n\\nThe comments about Travis and Swift’s romance came days after they seemingly confirmed their relationship. On 22 October, Swift made her return to Arrowhead Stadium to watch as the Kansas City Chiefs won their game against the Los Angeles Chargers. The occasion marked Swift’s fourth time attending one of Kelce’s games, amid ongoing reports that they are dating.\\n\\nFollowing the event, Chariah Gordon, the partner of Kelce’s teammate Mecole Hardman Jr, took to Instagram to share a snap of the singer and NFL player’s sweet PDA moment. In the picture, Swift could be seen standing next to Kelce, reaching to kiss his cheek.\\n\\nIn addition to the kiss, the football star also had the perfect reaction to a fan calling him Swift’s boyfriend. After a fan shouted: “Let’s go Taylor’s boyfriend” while Kelce was waiting for an elevator, he responded with a small smile on his face and by pumping his fist into the air.\\n\\nAside from their appearances at sports events, Swift and Kelce have also been photographed together on other occasions, including a date earlier this month in New York City after their surprise appearances on the season 49 premiere of Saturday Night Live. At the time, sources alleged to Entertainment Tonight that, during the date, Kelce got a little too close to Swift’s security personnel and allegedly told her bodyguard to step aside.\\n\\nHowever, during an episode of his podcast, Kelce explained what he said to the security, and clarified that he didn’t push the bodyguard. “I placed my hand on the gentleman’s back to let him know I was behind him. If I would have pushed him, he probably would have turned around and tased me,” he said.\\n\\nThe Independent has contacted representatives for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce for contact.'"

ai impact the us primary elections? what's next for openai? here are our predictions for ai in 2024.\\n\\nthis last year was a banger for ai as the technology went from niche to mainstream about as fast as anything ever has. 2024, however, will be the year when the hype runs full-steam into reality as people reckon with the capabilities and limitations of ai at large. here are a few ways we think that\\u2019s going to play out.\\n\\nopenai becomes a product company\\n\\nafter the leadership shake-up in november, openai is going to be a changed company \\u2014 perhaps not outwardly, but the trickle-down effect of sam altman being more fully in charge will be felt at every level. and one of the ways we expect that to manifest is in \\u201cship it\\u201d mindset.\\n\\nwe\\u2019ll see that with the gpt store, originally planned for launch in december but understandably delayed due to the c-suite fracas. the \\u201capp store for ai\\u201d will be pushed hard as the platform to get your ai toys and tools from, and never mind hugging face or any open source models. they have an excellent model to work from, apple\\u2019s, and will follow it all the way to the bank.\\n\\nexpect more moves like that from 2024\\u2019s openai as the caution and academic reserve that the previous board exerted gives way to an unseemly lust for markets and customers.\\n\\nother major companies with ai efforts will also follow this trend (for instance, expect gemini/bard to horn in on a ton of google products), but i suspect it will be more pronounced in this case.\\n\\nagents, generated video and generated music graduate from quaint to experimental\\n\\nsome niche applications of ai models will grow beyond \\u201ceh\\u201d status in 2024, including agent-based models and generative multimedia.\\n\\nif ai is going to help you do more than summarize or make lists of things, it\\u2019ll need access to things like your spreadsheets, ticket buying interfaces, transportation apps and so on. 2023 saw a few tentative attempts at this \\u201cagent\\u201d approach, but none really caught on. we don\\u2019t really expect any to really take off in 2024, either, but agent-based models will show their stuff a little more convincingly than they did last year, and a few clutch use cases will show up for famously tedious processes like submitting insurance claims.\\n\\nvideo and audio will also find niches where their shortcomings aren\\u2019t quite so visible. in the hands of skilled creators, a lack of photorealism isn\\u2019t a problem, and we\\u2019ll see ai video used in fun and interesting ways. likewise, generative music models will likely make it into a few major productions like games, again where professional musicians can leverage the tools to create an unending soundtrack.\\n\\nthe limits of monolithic llms become clearer\\n\\nso far there has been great optimism about the capabilities of large language models, which have indeed proved more capable than anyone expected, and have grown correspondingly more so as more compute is added. but 2024 will be the year something gives. where exactly it is impossible to predict, as research is active at the frontiers of this field.\\n\\nthe seemingly magical \\u201cemergent\\u201d capabilities of llms will be better studied and understood in 2024, and things like their inability to multiply large numbers will make more sense.\\n\\nin parallel, we will begin to see diminishing returns on parameter counts, to the point where training a 500-billion-parameter model may technically produce better results, but the compute required to do so could provably be deployed more effectively. a single monolithic model is unwieldy and expensive, while a mixture of experts \\u2014 a collection of smaller, more specific models and likely multimodal ones \\u2014 may prove almost as effective while being much easier to update piecemeal.\\n\\nmarketing meets reality\\n\\nthe simple fact is that the hype built up in 2023 is going to be very hard for companies to follow through on. marketing claims made for machine learning systems that companies adopted in order to not fall behind will receive their quarterly and yearly reviews\\u2026 and it\\u2019s very likely they will be found wanting.\\n\\nexpect a considerable customer withdrawal from ai tools as the benefits fail to justify the costs and risks. on the far end of this spectrum, we are likely to see lawsuits and regulatory action with ai service providers that failed to back up their claims.\\n\\nwhile capabilities will continue to grow and advance, 2023\\u2019s products will not all survive by a long shot, and there will be a round of consolidation as the wobblier riders of the wave fall and are consumed.\\n\\napple jumps in\\n\\napple has an established pattern of waiting, watching and learning from other companies\\u2019 failures, then blowing in with a refined and polished take that puts others to shame. the timing is right for apple to do this in ai, not just because if it waits too long its competition may eat up the market, but because the tech is ripe for their kind of improvement.\\n\\ni would expect an ai that focuses on practical applications of users\\u2019 own data, using apple\\u2019s increasingly central position in their lives to integrate the many signals and ecosystems the company is privy to. there will likely also be a clever and elegant way to handle problematic or dangerous prompts, and although it will almost certainly have multimodal understanding (primarily to handle user images), i imagine they\\u2019ll totally skip media generation. expect some narrowly tailored but impressive agent capabilities as well: \\u201csiri, get a table for 4 at a sushi place downtown around 7 and book a car to take us\\u201d sort of thing.\\n\\nwhat\\u2019s hard to say is whether they will bill it as an improved siri or as a whole new service, apple ai, with a name you can choose yourself. they may feel the old brand is freighted with years of being comparatively incapable, but millions already say \\u201chey siri\\u201d every 10 seconds so it\\u2019s more likely they\\u2019ll opt to keep that momentum.\\n\\nlegal cases build and break\\n\\nwe saw a fair number of lawsuits filed in 2023, but few saw any real movement, let alone success. most suits over copyright and other missteps in the ai industry are still pending. 2024 will see a lot of them fall by the wayside, as companies stonewall critical information like training data and methods, making allegations like the use of thousands of copyrighted books difficult to prove in court.\\n\\nthis was only the beginning, however, and many of these lawsuits were filed essentially on principle. though they may not succeed, they may crack the process open far enough during testimony and discovery that companies would rather settle than have certain information come to light. 2024 will bring new lawsuits as well, ones pertaining to misuse and abuse of ai, such as wrongful termination, bias in hiring and lending, and other areas where ai is being put to work without a lot of thought.\\n\\nbut while a few egregious examples of
